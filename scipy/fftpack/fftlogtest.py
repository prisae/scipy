# # FFTLog
# 
# This notebook is a translation of `fftlogtest.f` from the Fortran package `FFTLog`, which was presented in Appendix B of Hamilton, 2000, and published at <http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog>. It serves as an example for the python package `pyfftlog` (which is a Python version of `FFTLog`), in the same manner as the original file `fftlogtest.f` serves as an example for Fortran package `FFTLog`.

# ## This is fftlogtest.f
# 
# This is a simple test program to illustrate how `FFTLog` works.
# The test transform is:
# 
# $$
# \int^\infty_0 r^{\mu+1} \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{2} \right)\
# J_\mu(k, r)\ k\ {\rm d}r = k^{\mu+1} \exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{2}
# \right) $$
# 
# 
# **Disclaimer:**  
# `FFTLog` does NOT claim to provide the most accurate possible
# solution of the continuous transform (which is the stated aim
# of some other codes).  Rather, `FFTLog` claims to solve the exact
# discrete transform of a logarithmically-spaced periodic sequence.
# If the periodic interval is wide enough, the resolution high
# enough, and the function well enough behaved outside the periodic
# interval, then `FFTLog` may yield a satisfactory approximation
# to the continuous transform.
# 
# Observe:
# 1.  How the result improves as the periodic interval is enlarged.
#     With the normal FFT, one is not used to ranges orders of
#     magnitude wide, but this is how `FFTLog` prefers it.
# 2.  How the result improves as the resolution is increased.
#     Because the function is rather smooth, modest resolution
#     actually works quite well here.
# 3.  That the central part of the transform is more reliable
#     than the outer parts.  Experience suggests that a good general
#     strategy is to double the periodic interval over which the
#     input function is defined, and then to discard the outer
#     half of the transform.
# 4.  That the best bias exponent seems to be $q = 0$.
# 5.  That for the critical index $\mu = -1$, the result seems to be
#     offset by a constant from the 'correct' answer.
# 6.  That the result grows progressively worse as mu decreases
#     below -1.
# 
# The analytic integral above fails for $\mu \le -1$, but `FFTLog`
# still returns answers.  Namely, `FFTLog` returns the analytic
# continuation of the discrete transform.  Because of ambiguity
# in the path of integration around poles, this analytic continuation
# is liable to differ, for $\mu \le -1$, by a constant from the 'correct'
# continuation given by the above equation.
# 
# `FFTLog` begins to have serious difficulties with aliasing as
# $\mu$ decreases below $-1$, because then $r^{\mu+1} \exp(-r^2/2)$ is
# far from resembling a periodic function.
# You might have thought that it would help to introduce a bias
# exponent $q = \mu$, or perhaps $q = \mu+1$, or more, to make the
# function $a(r) = A(r) r^{-q}$ input to `fhtq` more nearly periodic.
# In practice a nonzero $q$ makes things worse.
# 
# A symmetry argument lends support to the notion that the best
# exponent here should be $q = 0,$ as empirically appears to be true.
# The symmetry argument is that the function $r^{\mu+1} \exp(-r^2/2)$
# happens to be the same as its transform $k^{\mu+1} \exp(-k^2/2)$.
# If the best bias exponent were q in the forward transform, then
# the best exponent would be $-q$ that in the backward transform;
# but the two transforms happen to be the same in this case,
# suggesting $q = -q$, hence $q = 0$.
# 
# This example illustrates that you cannot always tell just by
# looking at a function what the best bias exponent $q$ should be.
# You also have to look at its transform.  The best exponent $q$ is,
# in a sense, the one that makes both the function and its transform
# look most nearly periodic.

# ### Import `pyfftlog` as well as `numpy` and `matplotlib`; some plot settings

# In[1]:

import fftpack                 # generated with scipy/scipy/fftpack> python setup.py install
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')
plt.style.use('ggplot')
mpl.rcParams.update({'font.size': 16})


# ### Define the parameters you wish to use
# 
# The presets are the *Reasonable choices of parameters* from `fftlogtest.f`.

# In[2]:

# Range of periodic interval
logrmin = -6
logrmax = 6

# Number of points (Max 4096)
n = 256

# Order mu of Bessel function
mu = 0

# Bias exponent: q = 0 is unbiased
q = 0

# Sensible approximate choice of k_c r_c
kr = 1
kropt = 0

# Forward transform (changed from dir to tdir, as dir is a python fct)
tdir = 1


# ### Calculation related to the logarithmic spacing

# In[3]:

# Central point log10(r_c) of periodic interval
logrc = (logrmin + logrmax)/2

print('Central point of periodic interval at log10(r_c) = ', logrc)

# Central index (1/2 integral if n is even)
nc = (n + 1)/2.0

# Log-spacing of points
dlogr = (logrmax - logrmin)/n
dlnr = dlogr*np.log(10.0)


# ### Calculate input function: $r^{\mu+1}\exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{2}\right)$

# In[4]:

r = 10**(logrc + (np.arange(1, n+1) - nc)*dlogr)
ar = r**(mu + 1)*np.exp(-r**2/2.0)


# ### Call `fht`

# In[5]:

ak = fftpack.rfht(ar, dlnr, mu, q, kr, kropt)


# ### Calculate Output function: $k^{\mu+1}\exp\left(-\frac{k^2}{2}\right)$

# In[6]:

# logrmin=-logrmax, kr=1, kropt=0 => r = k
k = r
theo = k**(mu + 1)*np.exp(-k**2/2.0)
