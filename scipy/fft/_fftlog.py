Python version of the FFTLog algorithm
======================================

This is a Python version of the Fortran-FFTLog algorithm by Andrew Hamilton:

Hamilton, A. J. S., 2000, Uncorrelated modes of the non-linear power spectrum:
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 312, pages 257-284; DOI:

http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog.

FFTLog computes the discrete Fast Fourier Transform or Fast Hankel Transform
(of arbitrary real index) of a periodic logarithmic sequence.

The function `scipy.special.loggamma` replaces the file `cdgamma.f` in the
original code, and the functions `rfft` and `irfft` from `scipy.fftpack`
replace the files `drffti.f`, `drfftf.f`, and `drfftb.f` in the original code.

Permission to distribute this modified FFTLog under the BSD-3-Clause license
has been granted (email from Andrew Hamilton to Dieter WerthmÃ¼ller dated 07

    """Fourier transform of a logarithmically spaced periodic sequence.

    Fast Fourier transform of a real, discrete periodic sequence of
    logarithmically spaced points.

    `fftlog` computes a discrete version of the Fourier sine or cosine
    transform

    .. math::

        G = \sqrt{2/\pi} \int_0^\infty F(r) \sin(kr) dr,

        G = \sqrt{2/\pi} \int_0^\infty F(r) \cos(kr) dr


    by making the substitutions

    .. math::

        F(r) = f(r) r^{ \mu - 1/2},

        G(k) = g(k) k^{-\mu - 1/2}

    and applying a biased Hankel transform to f(r);
    mu = 1/2 for the sine and -1/2 for the cosine transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, real-valued
        Array F(r) to transform: f(j) is F(r_j) at r_j = r_c exp[(j-jc) dlnr],
        where jc = (n+1)/2 = central index of array.

    spacing : float, optional
        Separation between input-points (log10); may be positive or negative.
        Default is 0.01.

    transform : string, optional; {'sine', 'cosine'}
        Transform type to use, which defines index of J_mu in Hankel transform:
        mu is 0.5 for a sine transform and -0.5 for a cosine transform. Default
        is 'sine' (mu=0.5).

    bias : float, optional
        Exponent of power law bias; bias may be any real number, positive or
        negative. If in doubt, use bias = 0, for which case the Hankel transform
        is orthogonal, i.e. self-inverse, provided also that, for n even, kr is
        low-ringing. Non-zero bias may yield better approximations to the
        continuous Hankel transform for some functions. Default is 0
        (unbiased).

    kr : float, optional
        k_c r_c where c is central point of array
        = k_j r_(n+1-j) = k_(n+1-j) r_j .
        Normally one would choose kr to be about 1 (default) (or 2, or pi, to
        taste). Default is 1.

    rk : float, optional
        r_c/k_c = r_j/k_j (a constant, the same constant for any j); rk is not
        (necessarily) the same quantity as kr. rk is used only to multiply the
        output array by sqrt(rk)^dir, so if you want to do the normalization
        later, or you don't care about the normalization, you can set rk = 1.
        Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    y : real ndarray
        Transformed array G(k): g(j) is G(k_j) at k_j = k_c exp[(j-jc) dlnr].

       A(r) = a(r) r          and   Ã(k) = Ã£(k) k

    and applying a biased Hankel transform to a(r).

    The steps are:
    1. a(r) = A(r) r^[-dir*(q-.5)]

    3. Ã(k) = Ã£(k) k^[-dir*(q+.5)]

    fhti must be called before the first call to fftlog, with mu = 1/2 for a
    sine transform, or mu = -1/2 for a cosine transform.

    A call to fftlog with dir=1 followed by a call to fftlog with dir=-1 (and
    rk unchanged), or vice versa, leaves the array a unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array
        Array A(r) to transform: a(j) is A(r_j) at r_j = r_c exp[(j-jc) dlnr],
        where jc = (n+1)/2 = central index of array.

    xsave : array
        Working array set up by fhti.

    rk : float, optional
        r_c/k_c = r_j/k_j (a constant, the same constant for any j); rk is not
        (necessarily) the same quantity as kr.  rk is used only to multiply the
        output array by sqrt(rk)^dir, so if you want to do the normalization
        later, or you don't care about the normalization, you can set rk = 1.
        Defaults to 1.

    tdir : int, optional; {1, -1}
        -  1 for forward transform (default),
        - -1 for backward transform.
        A backward transform (dir = -1) is the same as a forward transform with
        q -> -q and rk -> 1/rk, for any kr if n is odd, for low-ringing kr if n
        is even.

    Use of this routine is optional.

    Choosing kr so that

    makes the transition of this function across the period boundary smoother.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : float
        index of J_mu in Hankel transform; mu may be any real number, positive
        or negative.

    q : float
        exponent of power law bias; q may be any real number, positive or
        negative.  If in doubt, use q = 0, for which case the Hankel transform
        is orthogonal, i.e. self-inverse, provided also that, for n even, kr is
        low-ringing.  Non-zero q may yield better approximations to the
        continuous Hankel transform for some functions.

    dlnr : float
        separation between natural log of points; dlnr may be positive or
